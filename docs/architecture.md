# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

ModelMuxer is designed as a high-performance, scalable LLM routing engine with the following key components:

### Core Components

- **Router Engine**: Intelligent model selection and routing
- **Provider Clients**: Unified interface to LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral)
- **Cost Tracker**: Real-time usage and budget monitoring
- **Cache Layer**: Response and routing decision caching
- **Analytics Engine**: Performance metrics and insights

### Request Flow

1. **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and authentication
2. **Routing Decision**: AI-powered model selection based on query analysis
3. **Provider Call**: Optimized API calls to selected LLM provider
4. **Response Processing**: Unified response format and cost calculation
5. **Caching & Analytics**: Store results and update usage metrics

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **FastAPI**: High-performance async web framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM with async support
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data storage

### AI/ML Components

- **Transformers**: Text classification and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models for routing
- **NLTK/spaCy**: Natural language processing
- **Custom embeddings**: Query similarity and caching

### Infrastructure

- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration and scaling
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Monitoring dashboards

## Routing Strategy

### Heuristic Routing (Current Implementation)

Intelligent routing based on prompt analysis:

- **Code Detection**: Identifies programming-related queries using pattern matching
- **Complexity Analysis**: Evaluates query complexity using keyword analysis
- **Cost Optimization**: Selects models based on budget constraints and task requirements
- **Provider Selection**: Routes to optimal provider/model combination

The router analyzes incoming prompts and classifies them as:

- **Code**: Programming, debugging, or technical implementation tasks
- **Complex**: Analysis, research, or multi-step reasoning tasks
- **Simple**: Basic questions or straightforward requests
- **General**: Default category for unclassified queries

## Data Flow

### Request Processing Pipeline

```
Client Request → Authentication → Rate Limiting → Query Analysis →
Model Selection → Provider API Call → Response Processing →
Cost Calculation → Caching → Response to Client
```

### Analytics Pipeline

```
Request Metrics → Real-time Aggregation → Time-series Storage →
Dashboard Updates → Alert Processing → Reporting
```
