# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

ModelMuxer is designed as a high-performance, scalable LLM routing engine with the following key components:

### Core Components
- **Router Engine**: Intelligent model selection and routing
- **Provider Clients**: Unified interface to LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral)
- **Cost Tracker**: Real-time usage and budget monitoring
- **Cache Layer**: Response and routing decision caching
- **Analytics Engine**: Performance metrics and insights

### Request Flow
1. **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and authentication
2. **Routing Decision**: AI-powered model selection based on query analysis
3. **Provider Call**: Optimized API calls to selected LLM provider
4. **Response Processing**: Unified response format and cost calculation
5. **Caching & Analytics**: Store results and update usage metrics

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async web framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM with async support
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data storage

### AI/ML Components
- **Transformers**: Text classification and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models for routing
- **NLTK/spaCy**: Natural language processing
- **Custom embeddings**: Query similarity and caching

### Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration and scaling
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Monitoring dashboards

## Routing Strategies

### Hybrid Routing (Default)
Combines multiple factors: cost, quality, latency, and query complexity

### Cascade Routing
Tries cheaper models first, falls back to premium models if quality threshold not met

### Quality-First Routing
Prioritizes response quality over cost considerations

### Cost-Optimized Routing
Minimizes costs while maintaining acceptable quality thresholds

## Data Flow

### Request Processing Pipeline
```
Client Request → Authentication → Rate Limiting → Query Analysis → 
Model Selection → Provider API Call → Response Processing → 
Cost Calculation → Caching → Response to Client
```

### Analytics Pipeline
```
Request Metrics → Real-time Aggregation → Time-series Storage → 
Dashboard Updates → Alert Processing → Reporting
```

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application design
