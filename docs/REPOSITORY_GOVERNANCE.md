# Repository Governance and Branch Protection Setup

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive recommendations for establishing professional repository governance, branch protection rules, and development workflows for the ModelMuxer project.

## Current Repository Status

- **Repository**: `iamapsrajput/modelmuxer`
- **Default Branch**: `main`
- **Current Protection**: None (branch not protected)
- **Active Workflows**: 8 GitHub Actions workflows
- **Security Features**: Dependabot, secret scanning enabled

## Recommended Branching Strategy

### **GitHub Flow (Recommended)**

We recommend implementing **GitHub Flow** for this project due to its simplicity and effectiveness for continuous deployment:

```text
main (protected)
├── feature/add-new-provider
├── feature/improve-routing
├── hotfix/security-patch
└── release/v1.2.0
```

#### **Branch Types**

1. **`main`** - Production-ready code

   - Always deployable
   - Protected with strict rules
   - All changes via Pull Requests

2. **`feature/*`** - New features and enhancements

   - Branch from `main`
   - Merge back to `main` via PR
   - Delete after merge

3. **`hotfix/*`** - Critical production fixes

   - Branch from `main`
   - Fast-track review process
   - Immediate deployment capability

4. **`release/*`** - Release preparation (optional)
   - For version tagging and release notes
   - Final testing before production

## Branch Protection Rules

### **Main Branch Protection Configuration**

#### **Required Settings**

1. **Restrict pushes to matching branches**

   - ✅ Enable
   - Prevents direct commits to main

2. **Require a pull request before merging**

   - ✅ Enable
   - ✅ Require approvals: **2 reviewers**
   - ✅ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
   - ✅ Require review from code owners (when CODEOWNERS file exists)
   - ✅ Restrict approvals to users with write permissions

3. **Require status checks to pass before merging**

   - ✅ Enable
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - **Required Status Checks**:
     - `test` (from test.yaml workflow)
     - `build` (from build.yaml workflow)
     - `license-compliance` (from license-compliance.yaml workflow)
     - `security-scan` (from security.yaml workflow)
     - `code-quality` (from code-quality.yaml workflow)

4. **Require conversation resolution before merging**

   - ✅ Enable
   - All PR comments must be resolved

5. **Require signed commits**

   - ✅ Enable (recommended for security)

6. **Require linear history**

   - ✅ Enable
   - Prevents merge commits, enforces rebase/squash

7. **Allow force pushes**

   - ❌ Disable

8. **Allow deletions**
   - ❌ Disable

#### **Administrative Settings**

- **Include administrators**: ❌ Disable
  - Even admins must follow the rules
- **Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests**: ❌ Disable

## GitHub Repository Settings

### **General Settings**

```yaml
# Recommended repository settings
merge_options:
  allow_merge_commit: false # Disable merge commits
  allow_squash_merge: true # Enable squash merging (recommended)
  allow_rebase_merge: true # Enable rebase merging
  delete_branch_on_merge: true # Auto-delete feature branches

pull_requests:
  allow_auto_merge: true # Enable auto-merge when checks pass
  allow_update_branch: true # Allow updating PR branches

security:
  dependabot_security_updates: true
  secret_scanning: true
  secret_scanning_push_protection: true
  vulnerability_alerts: true
```

### **Required Status Checks**

Based on current workflows, configure these required checks:

1. **`test`** - Unit and integration tests
2. **`build`** - Docker build verification
3. **`license-compliance`** - License compliance check
4. **`security-scan`** - Security vulnerability scan
5. **`code-quality`** - Code quality metrics and analysis

## Code Owners Configuration

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS` file:

```gitignore
# Global owners

## Release Management

### **Semantic Versioning**

Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases:

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### **Release Process**

1. **Create Release Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
   ```

2. **Update Version Numbers**

   - Update `pyproject.toml`
   - Update documentation
   - Update CHANGELOG.md

3. **Create Release PR**

   - Comprehensive testing
   - Documentation review
   - Security scan

4. **Tag and Release**

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
   git push origin v1.2.0
   ```

5. **GitHub Release**
   - Create GitHub release from tag
   - Include release notes
   - Attach build artifacts

## Security Considerations

### **Required Security Measures**

1. **Signed Commits**: Require GPG-signed commits
2. **Secret Scanning**: Enable GitHub secret scanning
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Use Dependabot for vulnerability alerts
4. **Code Scanning**: Implement CodeQL or similar
5. **Branch Protection**: Strict protection rules on main branch

### **Security Workflow**

Add security scanning to CI/CD:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yaml
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Bandit Security Scan
        run: |
          pip install bandit
          bandit -r app/ -f json -o bandit-report.json
      - name: Upload Security Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: security-report
          path: bandit-report.json
```

## Implementation Steps

### **Phase 1: Immediate Setup (Day 1)**

1. **Enable Branch Protection**

   ```bash
   # Use GitHub CLI or web interface
   gh api repos/iamapsrajput/modelmuxer/branches/main/protection \
     --method PUT \
     --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["test","build","license-compliance"]}' \
     --field enforce_admins=true \
     --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":2,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true}' \
     --field restrictions=null
   ```

2. **Create CODEOWNERS file**
3. **Add PR and Issue templates**
4. **Update repository settings**

### **Phase 2: Process Implementation (Week 1)**

1. **Team training on new workflow**
2. **Documentation updates**
3. **Security scanning integration**
4. **Release process documentation**

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Month 1)**

1. **Automated dependency updates**
2. **Advanced security scanning**
3. **Performance monitoring integration**
4. **Compliance reporting automation**

## Monitoring and Compliance

### **Key Metrics to Track**

1. **Pull Request Metrics**

   - Average time to merge
   - Review coverage
   - Failed status checks

2. **Security Metrics**

   - Vulnerability detection rate
   - Time to fix security issues
   - Compliance score

3. **Quality Metrics**
   - Test coverage
   - Code quality scores
   - Documentation coverage

### **Regular Reviews**

- **Weekly**: PR and security metrics review
- **Monthly**: Process effectiveness review
- **Quarterly**: Governance policy updates

## Conclusion

This governance framework provides a robust foundation for professional software development while maintaining security and quality standards. The recommended settings balance security with developer productivity, ensuring that the ModelMuxer project can scale effectively while maintaining high standards.

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 1 changes immediately
2. Schedule team training session
3. Begin Phase 2 implementation
4. Monitor metrics and adjust policies as needed
