### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/modelmuxer.git
cd ModelMuxer

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/iamapsrajput/ModelMuxer.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
# Install Poetry if you haven't already
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install dependencies (including ML dependencies for full development)
poetry install --with dev,ml

# Activate virtual environment
poetry shell
```

3. **Environment Setup**

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys (at least one provider required for testing)
```

4. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**

```bash
pre-commit install
```

5. **Verify Setup**

```bash
# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Start development server
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

### Making Changes

1. **Create a Branch**

```bash
# Update your fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make Your Changes**

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Your Changes**

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_router.py -v

# Run linting
poetry run flake8 app/ tests/
poetry run mypy app/

# Format code
poetry run black app/ tests/
poetry run isort app/ tests/
```

4. **Commit Your Changes**

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add cascade routing strategy

- Implement FrugalGPT-inspired cascade routing
- Add quality threshold configuration
- Include cost optimization logic
- Add comprehensive tests

Closes #123"
```

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat(router): add semantic routing strategy
fix(auth): resolve JWT token validation issue
docs: update API documentation
test(cache): add Redis cache integration tests
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Ensure Quality**

```bash
# Run full test suite
poetry run pytest

# Check code coverage (aim for >80%)
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term

# Lint and format
poetry run flake8 app/ tests/
poetry run black app/ tests/
poetry run isort app/ tests/
poetry run mypy app/
```

2. **Update Documentation**

- Update relevant documentation files
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update API documentation if needed

3. **Test Edge Cases**

- Test with different provider configurations
- Test error handling scenarios
- Test with various input types

### Submitting the PR

1. **Push Your Branch**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Create Pull Request**

- Go to GitHub and create a pull request
- Use the PR template
- Provide clear description of changes
- Link related issues

3. **PR Template**

```markdown
